# Hello, there! 👋

I'm John and I like to code for fun and to generate some numbers to look at, like website visits, package downloads, and GitHub stars.

I maintain a couple open-source projects and some free-as-in-beer websites, too.

Thanks for stopping by!

## 👯 Collaboration

If you'd like to team up, please [`git` in `touch`](https://johnfraney.ca/contact/)! (I couldn't help myself.)

I'm available for:

- Contract work
- Open-source contributions
- Full-time employment for an interesting company doing interesting work
