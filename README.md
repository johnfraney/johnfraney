# Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm John and I like to code for fun and to generate some numbers to look at, like website visits, package downloads, and GitHub stars.

I maintain a couple open-source projects and some free-as-in-beer websites, too.

Thanks for stopping by!

## ðŸ‘¯ Collaboration

If you'd like to team up, please get in touch!

I'm available for:

- Contract work
- Open-source contributions
- Full-time employment for an interesting company doing interesting work
